# This is a selenium automated test built for passing the technical assesment for CodeSolvers.
For CodeSolvers team: Hi dear CodeSolvers team, This is a C# Project build with Reqnroll framework (which is a reboot/fork of SpecFlow framework which I used a while ago).

---

# If you don't know the framework and are struggling running the project, just need to follow these steps:
1. Install a .NET IDE (I used Visual Studio 2022 Community — I’m not sure if this framework supports VS Code).
2. Install the Reqnroll extension.
3. Open the project.
4. Change capabilities `"deviceName"` and `"platformVersion"` inside the `appsettings.json` file.
5. Open Test Explorer.
6. Run all the tests.

---

If the project doesn't run after following the above steps, please update your Visual Studio IDE,  
if after that still doesn't run, put me a message or consult the official Reqnroll documentation: https://docs.reqnroll.net/latest/quickstart/index.html https://reqnroll.net/about/ 

# Thanks for reading!!!
